Hardware
********

nRF54L15 PDK has two crystal oscillators:

* High-frequency 32 MHz crystal oscillator (HFXO)
* Low-frequency 32.768 kHz crystal oscillator (LFXO)

The crystal oscillators can be configured to use either
internal or external capacitors.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Flashing
========

To run a sample on the nRF54L15, you need to install all the
required software.

This example shows the :ref:`hello_world_user` sample,
which uses the ``nrf54l15pdk_nrf54l15_cpuapp`` build target.

To build and program the sample to the nRF54L15 PDK, complete the following steps:

1. Connect the nRF54L15 PDK to you computer using the IMCU USB port on the PDK.
#. Navigate to the :file:`zephyr/samples/hello_world` folder containing the sample.
#. Build the sample by running the following command::

      west build -b nrf54l15pdk_nrf54l15_cpuapp

#. Program the sample using the standard |Zephyr| command.
   If you have multiple Nordic Semiconductor devices, make sure that only the nRF54L15 PDK
   you want to program is connected.

   .. code-block:: console

      west flash

   .. note::

      When programming the device, you might get an error similar to the following message::

         ERROR: The operation attempted is unavailable due to readback protection in
         ERROR: your device. Please use --recover to unlock the device.

      This error occurs when readback protection is enabled.
      To disable the readback protection, you must *recover* your device.

      Enter the following command to recover the core::

         west flash --recover

      The ``--recover`` command erases the flash memory and then writes a small binary into
      the recovered flash memory.
      This binary prevents the readback protection from enabling itself again after a pin
      reset or power cycle.

Testing the LEDs and buttons in the nRF54L15 PDK
************************************************

You can test the nRF54L15 PDK with a preprogrammed :ref:`blinky-sample` sample.

Complete the following steps to test if the PDK works correctly:

1. Connect the USB-C end of the USB-C cable to the **IMCU USB** port the nRF54L15 PDK.
#. Connect the other end of the USB-C cable to your PC.
#. Move the **POWER** switch to **On** to turn the nRF54L15 PDK on.

**LED2** will turn on and start to blink.

If something does not work as expected, contact Nordic Semiconductor support.
